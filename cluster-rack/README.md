# Computer Rack Case Generator module
An [OpenSCAD](http://www.openscad.org) module for creating rack cases.

This is designed for creating rack case for things on mount plates that my
other module creates. But it is generic enough that it should be able to
create case for other things that can slide in. Like PCB boards.

Current version on [GitHub](https://github.com/snemetz/OpenSCAD-Modules/tree/master/cluster-rack)

Customizable version will be created once I finish initial designs and some testing.
