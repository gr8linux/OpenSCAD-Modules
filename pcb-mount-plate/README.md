# Mount Plate Generator module
An [OpenSCAD](http://www.openscad.org) module for creating mount plates.

This is designed for create mount plates for SOC computer PCB boards.
But it is generic enough that it should be able to create any type of mounting plate.

Current version on [GitHub](https://github.com/snemetz/OpenSCAD-Modules/tree/master/pcb-mount-plate)

Customizable version will be created once I finish initial designs and some testing.
